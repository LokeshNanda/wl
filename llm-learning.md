# LLM learnings

## June 2025

### 21 Jun 2025
- [Model Analysis Tracker](https://artificialanalysis.ai/leaderboards/models) Great website to track model performances & comparisons.

### 25 Jun 2025
- Learnt about gihub pages & hosting static websites in it.
- Created a webpage https://lokeshnanda.github.io/wl/ where I would publish my daily notes.
- Identified the easiest and most economical way to create a domain would be using [Cloudflair domain](https://www.cloudflare.com/)

### 26 Jun 2025
- (Use-case in security space)[https://www.zenml.io/llmops-database/optimizing-security-threat-investigation-with-multi-model-llm-strategy]
- Insurance claim processing - Intersting use-case for Gen AI app.
- I observed, if one agent has too many tasks & tools to connect, it gets difficult to maintain the codebase as well it starts hallucinating. Mutil-agent architecture helps.

### 27 Jun 2025
- Model distillation is a process where a smaller, more efficient model (student) learns to mimic a larger, more powerful model (teacher)
  - Reduced cost.
